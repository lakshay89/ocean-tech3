                  "DLT, or Distributed Ledger Technology, is a broad term that
                  refers to technologies such as blockchain, which use
                  decentralized networks to record and handle data. However,
                  when discussing DLT in the context of SMS (Short Message
                  Service), it generally refers to the regulatory setup and
                  technology that help manage and protect SMS traffic. In
                  certain areas, especially in India, DLT is used to ensure that
                  SMS communications follow regulations and avoid spam and
                  fraudulent activities. This system requires companies to
                  register their SMS message templates and sender details with a
                  DLT platform. This process allows for the monitoring of SMS
                  traffic and ensures that messages are genuine and meet the
                  standards set by regulatory bodies. To sum up, DLT for SMS
                  involves using both technology and rules to control and secure
                  SMS communications, ensuring they are real and meet legal
                  standards."
